# Event Driven Architecture Example

This is a small dummy project I will develop over time to understand how to implement a span of applications that are connected via messages, aka. I seek to build an event driven architecture. Further the infrastructure required for such an architecture will mostly be handled by containers. For now I will use the Apache Kafka message broker straight from the source. The decision to not use the confluent version was made due to the fact, that at this point in time confluent-kafka 7.9.0 still needs zookeeper, which is one more infrastructure piece that I do not want to have / maintain. Going forward the aim is to provide a high level landscape map of the tools used. Let's see where this project is going...
